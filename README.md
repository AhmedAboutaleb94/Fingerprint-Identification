# Fingerprint-Identification
Fingerprint Indentification Using Different Machine Learning Algorithms
Run the imagepreprocessing.mlx first changing the location to the NIST data. 
Run the previous file along with ridgesegment.m, ridgeorient.m, ridgefreq.m, freqest.m, ridgefilter.m and derivative5.m
Run the SVM_HOG.mlx, KNN_HOG.mlx and CNN.mlx providing the location of the enhanced images.
